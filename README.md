Using FreeRTOS to control a task using semaphore and Interrupt along side with another continuous Task  
This Project used Two previous Drivers:  
1.GPIO_Driver--> which used to initialize General Purpose Input and output peripherals  
2.Interrupt_Driver--> Which is used to Intialize Interrupt From different ports
